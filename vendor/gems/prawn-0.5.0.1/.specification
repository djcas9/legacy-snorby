post_install_message: "\n  Welcome to Prawn, the best pure-Ruby PDF solution ever!\n  This is version 0.5 RC1\n   \n  Please note that you have downloaded a pre-release candidate gem,\n  which has some bugs, ugly spots, other bad things in it.  This gem is also\n  not fully backwards compatible, and may break existing code.\n\n  If you wish to revert until a stable release is ready, uninstall prawn 0.5.0,\n  prawn-core 0.5.0, prawn-layout 0.2.0 and prawn-format 0.2.0\n\n  For details on what has changed, see:\n    http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/notes/0.5\n\n  If you have questions, contact us at:\n    http://groups.google.com/group/prawn-ruby\n\n  To submit a patch or report a bug: \n    http://github.com/sandal/prawn\n\n  Prawn is meant for experienced Ruby hackers, so if you are new to Ruby, you\n  might want to wait until you've had some practice with the language before\n  expecting Prawn to work for you.  Things may change after 1.0, but for now\n  if you're not ready to read source code and patch bugs or missing features \n  yourself (with our help), Prawn might not be the right fit.\n\n  But if you know what you're getting yourself into, enjoy!\n  "
